# Jarvis AI Assistant

Jarvis AI Assistant is a Python-based voice-controlled assistant that can perform various tasks using speech recognition and the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model for conversational AI.

## Description

This project utilizes several libraries such as `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `webbrowser`, `datetime`, and `openai`. The AI assistant interacts with the user through speech recognition and provides responses using text-to-speech conversion. The functionalities include:

- Activating AI mode by mentioning "AI"
- Deactivating AI mode by mentioning "deactivate"
- Interacting in AI mode using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model for conversational responses
- Providing the current time when asked
- Exiting the assistant by saying "thank you for your service"

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Dependencies installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Set up the necessary API keys for OpenAI by creating a `.env` file and providing the OpenAI API key.
2. Run the `Jarvis.py` file.
3. Start interacting with Jarvis by speaking commands.

## How it Works

- The script listens to user commands using the microphone and processes them using the `speech_recognition` library.
- It activates AI mode when prompted and uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to respond to user queries and conversationally interact.
- The assistant can provide the current time and exit upon request.
